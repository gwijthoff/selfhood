<!--
  - background reading: Kenneth Goldsmith, *Fidget*
  - example from Essayism of writing exercise, sitting at a cafe for hours, describing everything you see
  - maybe next time: have students record/collect their data in some form for a week (spreadsheet, datavis, drawing, etc) and then exchange it with a classmate, who will be tasked with one week later submitting a 3rd person report on the portrait of this person through their data. This will contrast much better with the distributed memory project
  - one of the big purposes of this project: negotiating levels of access, thinking about tiers of openness/privacy, given that we "increasingly live our social lives in public" (Evans)
  - whether a digital interaction was initiated by the student or by someone else
  - the question of lurking
    - how do we record lurking? One student: "I was taken aback by the amount of time I spent on Facebook versus the very few interactions I had recorded on Facebook. I wish I could have had more access to a comprehensive set of data on the time I spent on Facebook and Instagram, videos watched, time spent scrolling, and time spent on specific pages and groups."
    - What about the non-users among students? Or those who don't leave many traces?
  - difficulty of recording everything
    - everyone agrees, it's really difficult to record every single interaction throughout the day. And it took a while to decide what to record. Perhaps this selection process is part of the learning? Decisions had to be made about what to log versus what to "tell" or "describe." Finding a balance between the data and the storytelling. Otherwise it gets tedious.
  - Was the third person perspective useful?  For some, it allows students to be more factual rather than reflective.
    - Super interesting when students try to infer from a fictional, third-person vantage point what the connection might be between that data subject's various interests and activities
  - Perhaps next time: use the Facebook data download, teach UNIX time stamps, text editors, JSON files, and Atom packages
  - the project made some students more discriminating about the types of data left behind: spatial, temporal, textual
  - Some students in general bookmark/save posts in Facebook and Instagram because it's easier to go back to them than it is to see a list of your likes
  - A "skeletal outline" of your day, as one student described it
  - The importance of journaling: of pausing periodically (daily, weekly, monthly) to stop and give an account of oneself
  - One student breaks things down on an axis of public/private data rather than image/text/map data, for example. So, coming back to the question of how we track/record "lurking" as an activity, one way can be to classify each piece of data on an axis of privacy and publicity.
    - I think it's best to leave all of these options open to students: spreadsheets, drawings, emojis, information visualizations, typographic marks. See what emerges from there so long as you lay out important things like privacy/publicity axis and third person perspective

For the week of March 25, from Tuesday through Friday, keep a data trails log. Every time you shed some data (a debit card transaction, using your phone number for frequent shopper rewards, an email, a status update, sharing your location data, etc.) mark it in your log. Don't try to actively avoid leaving trails, just passively make a note when you realize that you are leaving a breadcrumb of data behind.

Write your log from the perspective of your data. While in your Distributed Memory project you filled in the gaps of your personal data trails, here you will assemble a portrait from the outside, as if a third party. What do you look like from the perspective of your data?

Your log will be due before class on Monday, April 1.

## Tips

As much as possible, the logging should be frictionless. Over the course of a week, find a way to mark that piece of data as efficiently as possible. It's okay to gradually fine-tune your technique. You can keep the log, for example, in a notetaking app on your phone, or on an index card, or in a notebook. Experiment with graphics, numbers, sketches to find the best way to record your data.

## Inspiration

- browse postcards in the [Dear Data](https://www.dear-data.com/theproject) project. "Each week, and for a year, we collected and measured a particular type of data about our lives, used this data to make a drawing on a postcard-sized sheet of paper, and then dropped the postcard in an English 'postbox' (Stefanie) or an American 'mailbox' (Giorgia)!"
