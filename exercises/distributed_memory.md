<!--
  - student comments:
    - several students comment that the deeper they dug into the details of a day (the more messages/emails they read, etc), the more unfamiliar/distant/alien that past self felt. "A sort of anthropological fascination," writes one student.
    - one student writes that metadata allows us "to recall what a day was *like,* now that it *was.*"
    - several students write of a memory divide, or the privilege of being able to review intimate details of our past days, past selves, as a function of class and access to digital devices / infrastructures. Also national difference between platforms
    - that these data trails wouldn't mean anything to anyone besides myself
    - several students comment that they spend more time organizing digital files than physical files, and that digital memories are thus *more* tangible/durable. Even unimportant ephemeral things things like a library late notice by paper would be thrown out, but we keep the digital traces because why not.
  - many comment that the data trails are a spur to organic memories, rather than memories in and of themselves. But are the memories then of a different kind?
  - students discovering how mood and affect and texture can be recovered from literally the most boring possible moments of our lives using metadata. Meanwhile, novelists are still trying to figure out how to depict the vast swaths of our lives spent aimlessly on the internet, or connected to others tenuously/intimately/ambiguously through texting/lurking/ghosting.
  - the ways that lack of digital evidence can be evidence in itself
  - make sure that students who elected not to use social media or other platforms don't feel alienated from this exercise
  - who is the implied reader of our public social media posts? friends? lurkers? your future self? the public?
  - ask next time: now that you better understand how your past is being archived, will you change your practices to more consciously craft those memories in the moment? In what ways?
  - students most successful when they separated a section on the narrative of their day from a section reflecting on the experience of recalling this day
  - how do we reconcile the creepiness of this data being available with the access it gives us to the texture of our daily lives years ago? Will this change your data practices at all now? Only one student took concrete steps to limit data gathering as a result of this project. Weighing the relative merits of invasive/useful data
  - "I had personally remembered that year as a happy and carefree one, but as I was going through my history in all of these apps, I realized I was dealing with a lot at the time that I had chosen not to remember."
  - The strange fickleness of these memories when we're not in conscious control of them. We can upgrade our device, switch laptops, get locked out of an old account when we forget a password and lose some of the most important messages. But we can also find the most mundane, unimportant stuff: a grocery store receipt.

Using an arbitrarily selected calendar date that the class will agree on as a group (i.e. Wednesday, March 9, 2016), reconstruct a narrative of that day based on traces you have left behind both willingly and unwittingly: emails, Facebook likes, activity trackers, etc. Research your life on that day like a private investigator and be as exhaustive as possible. Then, write a ~3p narrative of this day using your digitally-distributed memories.

## Tips

Places you can explore include:

- emails
- social media platforms
- banking apps
- your phone's photo library
- activity trackers or Apple Health app
- Facebook activity log / Facebook Messenger log [see instructions for [downloading data here](https://www.wired.com/story/download-facebook-data-how-to-read/)]
- Google's ["My Activity"](https://myactivity.google.com/) (includes history of all Google products used: Maps, search, etc.)
- any notes apps
- computer files created/edited on that date
- calendar app
- [Netflix viewing history](https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity)

In order to search Gmail for messages on a specific date, use the following search string:

`from:me before:2016/3/10 after:2016/3/8`

For those of you who use Apple's iMessage and are technically adventurous, you can search your messages for a particular date [using the command line.](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/222836/how-to-seek-to-very-old-text-messages)

## Questions

How was this information collected? With or without your knowledge?

In our weekly "digital sabbath," weâ€™ve been reflecting on the experience of disconnection. But what forms of digital memorialization do we lose out on when we no longer have such a granular level of access to our daily lives in the past?

How do past forms of memorialization (note taking, photography, 8mm film cameras) compare to forms of memorialization today? Do you remember the moment you decided to take a given photo, and why, on March 9, 2016? Do you think you would be able to remember the moment you decided to memorialize something if you did so through an older medium (note, film photo, etc?)

How distant or close does that day feel now, two years later?
