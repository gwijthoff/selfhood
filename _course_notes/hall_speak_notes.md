"the nature of memory; the borders of personhood; how words can illumine and obscure and hoodwink and rescue."

"There’s Stephen Chinn, a tech wunderkind imprisoned after building “illegally lifelike” robots, and Gaby White, a young girl who is devastated when her robot is recalled. Alan Turing, the mathematician and code breaker, writes heartfelt letters to the mother of his best friend and dreams of machines that think. A Puritan teenager named Mary Bradford, having smuggled her dog aboard a ship to Massachusetts, wonders about the difference between human and animal souls and fills a diary with her apprehensions about marriage. In the 1960s, a Jewish refugee, Ruth Dettman, finds the diary and is enchanted. Her own relationship with the computer scientist Karl Dettman has gone cold; nevertheless, she persuades Karl to name the chat program he’s invented — and that he later disowns — MARY."

"Hall pulls here at the Wordsworthian idea of the recollected moment, the living voice tucked inside the mechanical tinkle of rhyme and meter. Her robotic minds are poems — vessels in which to keep shards of humanity. And so this book about artificial intelligence is also a book about form, physical and literary."

"But that is the implicit promise and threat of the entire book: Where there’s a voice, can a face be far behind?"

"Works of art have long cultivated a kind of artificial intelligence, from Keats’s living hand (which demands a transfusion of the reader’s lifeblood) to the beseeching gaze of the “Girl With a Pearl Earring.” The freshness — the brilliance, even — of “Speak” lies in its positioning of robots not as terrifyingly new, but as the latest in a long line of “magic mirrors” from which we are powerless to look away."
