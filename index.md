# Description 📱📖

The luddites, the philosophers, even the tech evangelists all seem to be in agreement that living in a networked world has changed something about the way we understand ourselves as individuals. But where should we locate the shifting boundaries between the self and the publics we connect with today? On the one hand, networked selfhood involves conscious, authorial acts. We compose sketches of our lives on social media for intimate strangers: high school classmates, public figures, acquaintances we've met only once. On the other hand, our carefully curated online profiles pale in comparison to the portraits of our lives being assembled by data brokers, government agencies, and Silicon Valley companies.

In this course, we will turn to novels for lessons in how personhood has been configured differently. Novels allow the reader to see contradictions between the inner and outer person, the character shared with the reader as opposed to the "self" that the character projects to her social world. How have figurations of characters, persons, selves, and individuals changed throughout the history of the novel? How do contemporary novelists represent the new forms of self-fashioning emerging online today? How can we use novels to renegotiate the relationship between privacy---the ability to selectively reveal oneself to the world---and intimacy---when we find ourselves disclosing to others the most important aspects of our lives?

Our weekly readings will mix recent works of media theory examining the self and its relationship to networked others with novels that register shifts or offer models of historically situated selfhood through either narrative means or formal experimentation.

# Required Books

The following books are required for the class, and are available at the campus book store. In addition to these books, we will be reading a number of articles in PDF that will all be linked to in the schedule below.

**30% Digital Sabbath Journal**

_[~10p of writing: 4x2p uploads, 2p final statement]_

On Sundays this term, we will institute a "digital sabbath." What this looks like is up to you. As a starting point, I suggest disconnecting all of your devices from the internet (phones in airplane mode, computer WiFi turned off) for at least six consecutive hours, ideally beginning from the time you wake up. Keep a journal of your experience during this period of disconnection, commenting on your concentration, creativity, productivity, loneliness, etc. Your journal should be kept in a fresh notebook at least 5"x8.5". You should have this notebook by our second week of classes.

Your journal can take the form of a diary, scrapbook, sketchbook, to-do list, or handwritten drafts of text messages and emails to be sent when you re-connect on Monday. Overall, it will serve as a repository for the ways you experience your sense of self differently when digitally disconnected, and how our class readings served as points of reference for those experiences.

Feel free to experiment with the ways you go about doing this. I want to hear about your techniques of disconnection. If you fail on any given day (that is, if you find yourself turning your Internet connection back on), that's okay. Reflect on the reasons why you felt that pressure to connect.

Throughout the semester, you will be required to provide four uploads from your journal. You will also be asked to produce an author's statement at the end of the semester reflecting on the experience, enumerating the subjects, themes, and ideas that you came across and that resonated with our readings throughout the semester.

Several aids will be discussed in class, including the [NoPhone](https://www.thenophone.com/), [Resistor Case](https://resistorcase.org/), and [IRL Glasses](https://www.irl-labs.co/).

**10% Distributed Memory Project**

_[~3 pages of writing]_

Using an arbitrarily selected calendar date that the class will agree on as a group (i.e. Wednesday, March 9, 2016), reconstruct a narrative of that day based on traces you have left behind both willingly and unwittingly: emails, Facebook likes, activity trackers, etc. Research your life on that day like a private investigator and be as exhaustive as possible. Then, write a narrative of this day using your digitally-distributed memories. How was this information collected? With or without your knowledge? In our digital sabbath, we'll reflect on the experience of disconnection. But what forms of digital memorialization do we lose out on when we no longer have such a granular level of access to our daily lives in the past?

<!--
Film photography, there was a conscious act of memorialization to press the shutter and take a photo. Even when looking at that photo, you remember that past conscious decision to memorialize that moment. We no longer do that with infinite cloud storage and smartphone photos. But what if we could think that way, consciously, "mindfully," about memory every time we use google calendar, or send an email, or make a purchase. These are otherwise frictionless acts, and the companies *want* them to be frictionless, to harvest more data/money from those interactions. But how would those practices change if we were more mindful about them?

-->

**10% Data Trails Log**

For the week of March 25, keep a data trails log. Every time you shed some data (a debit card transaction, using your phone number for frequent shopper rewards, an email, a status update, sharing your location data, etc.) mark it in your log. Don't try to actively avoid leaving trails, just passively make a note when you realize that you are leaving a breadcrumb of data behind. Ideally, this log will be kept in a notetaking app on your phone, so that you always have it with you. Keep your diary from the perspective of your data. As we will discuss in class, we in the United States cannot request our data from platforms like Facebook. And so the work of imaginative storytelling and narrative becomes important.

**25% Final Essay**

A final essay of 8-10 pages on one of our novels. Further details will follow.

**25% participation**

Class participation is vital to the success of this course. The importance of the works under discussion lies not in the works themselves, but rather in their interrelationship with our discussions and other media that you and I encounter in our daily lives. Simply attending class will not be enough to earn full participation credit. Instead, you must be an active participant, someone who comes prepared and engages with all aspects of the class.

Everyone shares responsibility for including all voices in the discussion.  If you have much to say, try to hold back a bit; if you are hesitant to speak, look for opportunities to contribute to the discussion.

# Exercises

In addition to our readings and class discussions, we will conduct exercises that allow us to regain a measure of authorship over the portraits of ourselves assembled by data brokers. Students will learn tactics for protecting against online harassment and trolling, as well as surveillance by government agencies who actively monitor the search results and social media activity of immigrants and citizens who speak with immigrants.

<!--NOTES

See Safiya Noble, p. 132 of PDF, on the “abstracted individual” of both racism and search engines. And think about how *Invisible Man* marked an endpoint of literary naturalism in thinking about type. Deep history of liberal individualism, starting in the 17c, of the “universal individual who was the bearer of equal political rights”, quoting Nancy Leys Stepan. Problems of “unmarked humanity—nonracialize, nongendered, and without class distinction—as the final goal of human transcendence.”

- How do our "smart" devices assume we want to be connected? What forms of algorithmically-determined and monetized intimacy do they force upon us? What kinds of "elective affinities" do they slot us into, filter bubbles, echo chambers?
- Novels are classically about the self? buildingsroman? are *all* novels about the self?
- Novels are also a technology of the self

- especially novels that question the notion of a representative person.
- Vice news tonight story on DHS announcement that social media monitoring among immigrants. Including "search results," which is not fully defined. Thursday night story. Adam Schwartz, EFF attorney. Citizens who speak with immigrants are subject to data collection. These policies began under Obama. Visa waiver programs required collection of social media data

# Administrivia

## Attendance

While I do not advocate missing any classes, I realize that you may face unpredictable circumstances once or twice throughout the term. For this reason, you may miss two classes this semester without penalty. Additional absences will impact your final grade. However (and this is important) you are responsible for seeking class notes from a classmate. I will not provide them.

Each additional absence will lower your final grade by half a letter grade. Students with perfect attendance receive a bonus on their participation grade. Two late arrivals count as an absence. Early departures also count as an absence.

## Laptop Policy

If you have a laptop, bring it to class. Periodically, we will use laptops for in-class exercises and experiments. Additionally, if you traditionally a laptop to take notes, feel free to do so; however, please practice good screen etiquette: keep it to the side and don’t stare too long. Our meetings are built around the capacity to listen and observe one another, to be mutually present in our shared physical space. Good screen etiquette allows this to happen.

## Late Assignments

Late assignments are accepted a week beyond the assignment’s due date. Late assignments will be marked down half a letter grade with each missed day.

## Honor Code

I regard plagiarism as a very serious matter. In this class, plagiarism consists of work taken partially or entirely from an uncited source (the Internet, a peer, a published article, etc.) and assumed as your own. If you are caught plagiarizing, I will ask that you report yourself to the Haverford and Bryn Mawr Honor Board.

## Campus Resources

Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges are committed to providing equal access to students with a documented disability. Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first register with Access Services. Bryn Mawr students should also contact Deb Alder, Coordinator of Access Services (610-526-7351 or <dalder@brynmawr.edu>), as soon as possible, to verify their eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations. Haverford students should contact Gabriela Moats, Coordinator of Accommodations, Office of Disabilities Services at <hc-ods@haverford.edu>. If you have already been approved to receive academic accommodations and would like to request accommodations in this course because of a disability, please meet with me privately at the beginning of the semester (within the first two weeks if possible) with your verification letter.

Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement. Any student who has a disability-related need to tape record this class must first speak with the Coordinator of Access Services and to me, the instructor. Because of laws within the State of Pennsylvania, class members need to be aware that this class may be recorded. More information can be obtained at the Access Services website (<http://www.brynmawr.edu/access_services/>).

### Bryn Mawr | Academic Support and Learning Resources

Students are encouraged to reach out to the Academic Support and Learning Resources Specialist to explore effective learning, studying, test-taking, note-taking and time and stress management strategies that are essential to success in this course and college life. Students can schedule a meeting with Rachel Heiser, the Academic Support and Learning Resources Specialist by calling the Dean's Office at (610)526-5375. For more information, please visit: <http://www.brynmawr.edu/deans/acad_support/learning_resources.shtml>

### Haverford | Office of Academic Resources (OAR)

Located at Haverford in Stokes Suite 118, the OAR offers students many resources, including communal study spaces, peer tutoring, workshop series, and individual coaching with the center’s trained staff. See their website for more information: <http://www.haverford.edu/oar/>.

### Writing Center

The Writing Center offers free appointments and experienced peer tutors who are there to help you at any stage of the writing process. The Writing Center is located in Canaday Library. You can get more information at <http://www.brynmawr.edu/writingcenter>.

At Haverford, the Writing Center is located in Magill Library, Stokes, and Zubrow Commons. You can get more information about hours and how to make an appointment at <http://www.haverford.edu/writing-center/>.
