# Description 📱📖

The luddites, the philosophers, even the tech evangelists all seem to be in agreement that living in a networked world has changed something about the way we understand ourselves as individuals. But where should we locate the shifting boundaries between the self and the publics we connect with today? On the one hand, networked selfhood involves conscious, authorial acts. We compose sketches of our lives on social media for intimate strangers: high school classmates, public figures, acquaintances we've met only once. On the other hand, our carefully curated online profiles pale in comparison to the portraits of our lives being assembled by data brokers, government agencies, and Silicon Valley companies.

In this course, we will turn to novels for lessons in how personhood has been configured differently. Novels allow the reader to see contradictions between the inner and outer person, the character shared with the reader as opposed to the "self" that the character projects to her social world. How have figurations of characters, persons, selves, and individuals changed throughout the history of the novel? How do contemporary novelists represent the new forms of self-fashioning emerging online today? How can we use novels to renegotiate the relationship between privacy---the ability to selectively reveal oneself to the world---and intimacy---when we find ourselves disclosing to others the most important aspects of our lives?

Our weekly readings will mix recent works of media theory examining the self and its relationship to networked others with novels that register shifts or offer models of historically situated selfhood through either narrative means or formal experimentation.

1) BMC uses a 0.0-4.0 grading scale, in the following increments: 3.0; 3.3; 3.7; 4.0 etc.  You should use this mode of grading throughout the semester, although you can use split increments (3.5, 3.6 etc) all the way up to the final grade.

2) Writing expectations for a 200 level are something like a total of 22-25 pages or more.

3) use so-called "creative" assignments only in addition to essay-style assignments.  Don't replace a final paper with a so-called "creative" assignment

4) don't assume all students have laptops

**25% participation**

Class participation is vital to the success of this course. The importance of the works under discussion lies not in the works themselves, but rather in their interrelationship with our discussions and other media that you and I encounter in our daily lives. Simply attending class will not be enough to earn full participation credit. Instead, you must be an active participant, someone who comes prepared and engages with all aspects of the class.

If reading seems like it's flagging, I reserve the right to introduce reading quizzes that will count toward your participation grade.

**30% Digital Sabbath Journal**

_[Roughly 10p of writing: 4x2p uploads, 2p final statement]_

On Sundays this term, we will institute a "digital sabbath." What this looks like is up to you. As a starting point, I suggest disconnecting all of your devices from the internet (phones in airplane mode, computer WiFi turned off) from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed on Sunday. Keep a journal of your experience during this period of disconnection, commenting on your concentration, creativity, productivity, loneliness, etc. Your journal should be kept in a fresh notebook at least 5"x8.5". You should have this book by our second week of classes.

Your journal can take the form of a diary, scrapbook, sketchbook, to-do list, or handwritten drafts of text messages and emails to be sent when you re-connect on Monday. Overall, it will serve as a repository for the ways you experience your sense of self differently when digitally disconnected, and how our class readings served as points of reference for those experiences.

Feel free to experiment with the ways you go about doing this. I want to hear about your techniques of disconnection. If you fail on any given day (that is, if you find yourself turning your Internet connection back on), that's okay. Reflect on the reasons why you felt that pressure to connect.

Throughout the semester, you will be required to provide four uploads from your journal. You will also be asked to produce an author's statement at the end of the semester reflecting on the experience, enumerating the subjects, themes, and ideas that you came across and that resonated with our readings throughout the semester.

Several aids will be discussed in class, including the [NoPhone](https://www.thenophone.com/), [Resistor Case](https://resistorcase.org/), and [IRL Glasses](https://www.irl-labs.co/).

**10% Data Trails Log**

For one week, keep a data trails log. Every time you shed some data (a debit card transaction, using your phone number for frequent shopper rewards, an email, a status update, sharing your location data, etc.) mark it in your log. Don't try to actively avoid leaving trails, just passively make a note when you realize that you are leaving a breadcrumb of data behind. Ideally, this log will be kept in a notetaking app on your phone, so that you always have it with you. Keep your diary from the perspective of your data. As we will discuss in class, in the United States we cannot request our data from platforms like Facebook. And so the work of imaginative storytelling and narrative becomes important.

**10% Distributed Memory Project**

_[Roughly 3 pages of writing]_

Using an arbitrarily selected calendar date that the class will agree on as a group (i.e. Wednesday, March 9, 2016), reconstruct a narrative of that day based on traces you have left behind both willingly and unwittingly: emails, Facebook likes, activity trackers, etc. Write a narrative of this day using your digitally-distributed memories. How was this information collected? With or without your knowledge? In our digital sabbath, we'll reflect on the experience of disconnection. But what forms of digital memorialization do we lose out on when we no longer have such a granular level of access to our daily lives in the past?

<!--
Film photography, there was a conscious act of memorialization to press the shutter and take a photo. Even when looking at that photo, you remember that past conscious decision to memorialize that moment. We no longer do that with infinite cloud storage and smartphone photos. But what if we could think that way, consciously, "mindfully," about memory every time we use google calendar, or send an email, or make a purchase. These are otherwise frictionless acts, and the companies *want* them to be frictionless, to harvest more data/money from those interactions. But how would those practices change if we were more mindful about them?

# Exercises

In addition to our readings and class discussions, we will conduct exercises that allow us to regain a measure of authorship over the portraits of ourselves assembled by data brokers. Students will learn tactics for protecting against online harassment and trolling, as well as surveillance by government agencies who actively monitor the search results and social media activity of immigrants and citizens who speak with immigrants.

This course will be an experiment. What questions are we asking? What do I want you to know at the outset? For one, the idea of fiction at work in everyday life (Michael Wood).

These aren't always novels that are directly about networks. Instead, they stage questions about the self and how we project ourselves to others.

# Administrivia

## Attendance

Weekly attendance in class is expected. If you must be absent from a session for a serious reason, then you should contact me before the missed class and explain why you will not be in attendance. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence will result in a penalty to your grade or your ineligibility to complete the course. Attendance and active participation in discussions are part of fulfilling the course requirements. I will notify an advising dean if you have three or more unwarranted absences.  No extensions will be given except in extreme (and verifiable) circumstances. These circumstances include reasons of health and extenuating circumstances, such as death of a family member.

## Laptop policy

If you have a laptop, bring it to class. **Only open it when asked.** When we are using laptops for in-class exercises, be sure to practice good screen etiquette: keep it to the side and don't stare too long.

## Honor Code

I regard plagiarism as a very serious matter. In this class, plagiarism consists of work taken partially or entirely from an uncited source (the Internet, a peer, a published article, etc.) and assumed as your own. If you are caught plagiarizing, I will ask that you report yourself to the Haverford and Bryn Mawr Honor Board.

## Campus Resources

Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges are committed to providing equal access to students with a documented disability. Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first register with Access Services. Bryn Mawr students should also contact Deb Alder, Coordinator of Access Services (610-526-7351 or <dalder@brynmawr.edu>), as soon as possible, to verify their eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations.
